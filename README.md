# SUDOKU_SOLVER
**Overview**

Sudoku Solver is an AI-powered project that uses computer vision techniques, deep learning, and backtracking algorithms to automatically solve Sudoku puzzles. The solver can take an image of a Sudoku puzzle as input, extract individual digits, recognize them using a deep learning model, and then apply a backtracking algorithm to find the correct solution.
